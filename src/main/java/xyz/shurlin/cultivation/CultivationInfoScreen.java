    // HandledScreen and ScreenHandler in Minecraft have a close relationship and work together to provide a user interface for interacting with inventories or containers.
    //
    // HandledScreen:
    // - HandledScreen is a class that extends Screen and provides additional functionality for screens that interact with inventories or containers.
    // - It handles input events such as mouse clicks and key presses, and manages the rendering of items and slots within the screen.
    // - HandledScreen is analogous to a "page" in a web application, as it represents the visual interface that the player interacts with.
    //
    // ScreenHandler:
    // - ScreenHandler is a class that manages the interaction between the player and the HandledScreen.
    // - It handles events related to inventory management, item transfers, and container interactions.
    // - ScreenHandler is responsible for updating the HandledScreen with relevant information, such as inventory contents and slot highlights.
    // - ScreenHandler is similar to a "controller" or "presenter" in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, as it handles the logic and data associated with the HandledScreen.
    //
    // Together, HandledScreen and ScreenHandler work in tandem to provide a seamless and interactive user experience for managing inventories or performing actions within the game.
    // They ensure that the player's interactions are properly handled and that the screen is updated accordingly.
